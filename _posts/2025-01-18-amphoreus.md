## Welcome to Amphoreus!
A few days ago, Honkai: Star Rail finally released Version 3.0 which introduced Amphoreus after an enormous amount of teasers in the last few months. I played through the entirety of the quest just a few hours after it released, and here are my thoughts on it. 

**But first!**

## VERY Basic Recap
March 7th got *"sick"* so everyone decided to stay behind except for the Trailblazer and Dan Heng. Unfortuntely, their car (gifted by Pompom) got struck down and crash landed into an unknown area. They are then lead to Okhema by Phainon and Tribbie where they're introduced to Aglaea, Mydei, and Castorice. Their goal is to collect the 12 Coreflames to save Amphoreus, and only 6 as of the Express Crew's arrival has been acquired. The Trailblazer, together with Mydei and Phainon succesfully gathered the 7th Coreflame, while back in the Astral Express... March 7th's condition took a horrible turn. The rest of the story continues on the next version...

## My Thoughts
This ENTIRE chapter took me around **8** hours to finish. **8**! This is undoubtely the *longest* it took me to finish a chapter, even longer than the [Slumbernana Monkey questline](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Banana_Outrage:_Battles_Without_Ninja_and_Humanity), which took 6 hours I remind you! If every chapter moving on will be as long or **even longer** than this... My brain's going to be drained. Although you could argue that you aren't supposed to just finish the entire chapter in one sitting, you can't deny that it's excruciatingly long. It doesn't really matter though as long as the story is interesting enough. So, is it?

Yeah, the story itself was actually really interesting. We get too meet all these new characters and *some* of their lore plus we learn the lore of Amphoreus along the way! Some parts are a bit boring, like where you had to traverse Janusopolis,  but that's probably just my fault since I always try to 100% all the new areas immediately once they're accesible. One of my favourite parts somehow is... Mem, the Trailblazer's... memosprite companion thing?

*Mem from the Wiki*
She... He? They? I'll just call Mem using *they/them*. They make a cameo on the beginning, but doesn't really appear again until the Trailblazer got a glance from Fuli. I don't really know what's the story behind Mem, but I really like them since they reminds me of Lingsha's Tuskpir, the undeniable overlord of cuteness!

## Conclusion
I'm not really the type to make reviews and such, so apologies if my thoughts weren't proffesional enough, or maybe because it was too short. Anyway, I'll be expecting more on Mem and maybe Castorice's lore on future versions. Oh yeah, and **what** happened to March!? I need to know! Anyway. that's about it. Thank you for reading!
