## Welcome to Amphoreus!
A few days ago, Honkai: Star Rail finally released Version 3.0 which introduced [Amphoreus](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Amphoreus) and 2 new characters ([The Herta](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/The_Herta) and [Aglaea](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Aglaea)). After months of teasers, it's finally here! I won't be discussing the new characters in this post yet but rather focusing on the story instead. I played through the entirety of the chapter just a few hours after it released, and here are my thoughts on it. But first... A recap!

## VERY Basic Recap
March 7th got *"sick"* so everyone decided to stay behind except for the [Trailblazer](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Trailblazer) and [Dan Heng](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Dan_Heng). Unfortunately, their car (gifted by [Pompom](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Pompom)) got struck down and crash landed into an unknown area. They are then lead to [Okhema](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Okhema) by [Phainon](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Phainon) and [Tribbie](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Tribbie) where they're introduced to Aglaea, [Mydei](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Mydei), and [Castorice](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Castorice). 
Amphoreus's goal is to collect the 12 [Coreflames](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Coreflames) to save Amphoreus, and only 6 as of the Express Crew's arrival has been acquired. The Trailblazer, together with Mydei and Phainon successfully gathered the 7th Coreflame. 
Then, we get a POV subchapter from The Herta (Herta's real form) trying to communicate with [Nous (Aeon of Erudition)](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Nous), but is interrupted by [Sunday](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Sunday) and [Welt](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Welt) who seeks her help on Amphoreus. Back in the [Astral Express though...](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Express) [March 7th](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/March_7th)'s condition took a horrible turn. The rest of the story continues on the next version...

## My Thoughts
This ENTIRE chapter took me around **8** hours to finish. **8**! This is undoubtedly the *longest* it took me to finish a main story chapter in this entire game so far, even longer than the [Slumbernana Monkey questline](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Banana_Outrage:_Battles_Without_Ninja_and_Humanity), which took 6 hours I remind you! If every chapter moving forwards will be as long or **even longer**... My brain's going to be drained. Although you could argue that you aren't supposed to just finish the entire chapter in one sitting, you can't deny that it's excruciatingly long. However, as long as the story is engaging, that doesn't matter too much. So, was it?

Yeah, the story itself was actually really interesting. We get too meet all these new characters and *some* of their lore plus we get to learn some insights on the lore of Amphoreus along the way! Some parts are a bit boring or tedious, like where you had to traverse Janusopolis,  but that's probably just my fault since I always try to 100% all the new areas immediately once they're accesible. One of my favourite parts somehow is... [Mem](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Mem), the Trailblazer's... memosprite companion thing?

*Mem from the Wiki*
She... He? They? I'll just call Mem using *they/them*. They make a cameo on the beginning, but doesn't really appear again until the Trailblazer got a glance from Fuli. I don't really know what's the story behind Mem, but I really like them since they remind me of [Lingsha's](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Linghsa) [Tuskpir](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Tuskpir), the undeniable overlord of cuteness!

## Conclusion
I'm not really the type to make reviews and such, so apologies if my thoughts weren't professional enough, or maybe because it was too short. Anyway, I'll be expecting more on Mem and maybe Castorice's lore on future versions. Oh yeah, and **what** happened to March!? I need to know! Anyway. that's about it. Thank you for reading!
