## Continuation of my previous project!
If you've seen the post before this, then let me explain. This is the battle system independently from the project that I want to improve and complete. It will include ***all*** characters and mechanics that I can possible code. It's still currently in Alpha, only having 7 characters for now, but it shows what the future of the project will be.

## What's the game about... again?
You already know what it is if you've played Honkai: Star Rail already. It's going to be turn based RPG mechanic but in Python code. You can visit the progress on characters and mechanics [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjmQjUh_pAk3HISZnoYRalzw-T1S8gF3gAQ2WJL9wwo/edit?tab=t.0). Here are the features listed : 

1. **All Characters**
    - While this version only has March, Natasha, Dan Heng, Qingque, Fu Xuan, Tingyun, and Jingliu, I'll continuously update the game to add all remaining characters slowly by slowly. Here is a list if you're too lazy to visit the website on that blue underlined *here* word above.

2. **Most Mechanics**
    - Outside just Crit effects right now, future versions of this project will include everything else like status effects (Freeze and DoT), Break Damage, and etc. Sorry, no image right now.

## Conclusion
This has been a really fun project to make, since It's completely under my control and I have full power on what I want to do with the project. It will take a while, but I'm up for the task.
