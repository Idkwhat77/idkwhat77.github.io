## Continuation of my previous project!
If you've seen the post before this, then let me explain. This is the battle system independently from the project that I want to improve and complete. It will include ***all*** characters and mechanics that I can possible code. It's still currently in Alpha, only having 7 characters for now, but it shows what the future of the project will be.

## What's the game about... again?
You already know what it is if you've played Honkai: Star Rail already. If not... It's going to be a turn based RPG type mechanic but completely in Python code. You can choose a maximum of 4 characters in your team and their turn will go on the order you added them (since I haven't implemented SPD mechanics yet). Each character will have their unique mechanics all within their **Basic Attack**, **Skill**, **Ultimate**, and **Talent**. Basic attacks are usually the exact same on most if not all characters, except for a few who has access to an enhanced basic attack like Qingque. Skills and Ultimates are all usually dependent on your character's path, like Abudance characters would have healing skill and ultimate capabilities.

You can visit the progress on characters and mechanics [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjmQjUh_pAk3HISZnoYRalzw-T1S8gF3gAQ2WJL9wwo/edit?tab=t.0) if you'd like.

## Features

1. **All Characters**
    - While this version only has March, Natasha, Dan Heng, Qingque, Fu Xuan, Tingyun, and Jingliu, I'll continuously update the game to add all remaining characters slowly by slowly. Here is a list if you're too lazy to visit the website on that blue underlined *here* word above.

    *Tier List Format*

    Fu Xuan, Tingyun, Dan Heng, Natasha should all be fully implemented, but Qingque needs a rework since her skill isn't exactly like how her skill works ingame. March's counterattack is currently bugged and doens't have a limit and Jingliu's not even fully finished. But yet, I decided to upload and post the project anyway, because why not?

2. **Most Mechanics**
    - Outside just Crit effects currently, future versions of this project will include everything else like status effects (Freeze and DoT), Break Damage, and etc. While Freeze is already implemented with March's ultimate, it hasn't been fully fleshed out yet. Sorry, no image right now.

You can watch a gameplay of the code [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm7DVXjADm8&feature=youtu.be) on Youtube if you're too lazy to download it or test it out yourself.
## Where to download?
I uploaded the directories the project is on to GitHub. Just click [here!](https://github.com/Idkwhat77/HSR-Python). 

## Conclusion
Apologies if this post was too short. I'm pretty new to this whole blog posting thing, so It won't all be perfect. Anyways, this has been a really fun project to make since It's completely under my control and I have full power on what I want to do with the project, which makes it the more interesting. It will take a while, but I'm up for the task.
