## Introduction
Before, we explain that some limit operations can result in a 0 divided by 0 so we have to resort to finding the limit using graphs. Here, we will discuss other ways to find the limit without looking at graphs all day. There are 3 ways to do this, which is...

## Direct Substitution
In *Direct Substitution*, all we have to do is well... substitute the value of whatever variable we have to the function directly. Here is an example!

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to 1} (2x - 1)
$$

The x here reaches the value of 1, so we can just substitute that right to the function in the left, which results in (2 x 1-1) = **1**. This doesn't apply to every limit operation though, especially *if it results in a 0/0.* If this happens, we have to resort to other methods, such as...

## Factoring

Some limit operations has functions in fractions (x/y). And as I've previously explained in my previous post, some can result in a **0/0**. A possible solution is to **factore** the numerator/denominator (if applicable). Think of it as breaking down the function into smaller pieces. An example is :

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x-1}
$$

If we directly substitute 1 into the function, it will always result in a 0/0. But... we can see that the numerator (x^1 - 1) can be further broken down with the formulas below

*Factoring Formulas*

From the rules above, we can get that (x^1 - 1) can be broken down to (x-1) (x+1) / (x-1). We can see that there are 2 (x-1)'s in the fraction, so we can just cross/delete them out and then the result will be :

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to 1} \frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x-1}
$$

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to 1} \frac{(x+1)\cancel{(x-1)}}{\cancel{x-1}}
$$

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to 1} (x+1)
$$

Now, we can directly substitute 1 into the function, which will result in **2**. There is another way other than factoring which is significantly harder depending on which formula you use. Introducing, derivatives!

## Derivatives

Derivatives are basically where we try to measure the difference between spots. Do they go higher or lower or something else? There are 2 ways that I'm personally used to, which is the **definitive** way and the **easy** way. The definitive formula is as such :

$$
f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

Unfortunately, I refuse to explain the definitive way because it is going to take way too long so I'll just revert to the easy way, which is : 

$$
f'(x) = n x^{n-1}
$$

From this formula, we can differentiate a function easily. Let's apply this to an example:

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to 1} 2x^2
$$

$$
f'(x) =  2*2x^2-1
$$

$$
f'(x) =  4x^1
$$

Now, we can use the x from the limit :

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to 1}  4x^1
$$

$$
\lim\limits_{x \to 1}  4*1^1 = 4
$$

## Conclusion
We explored three main ways to solve limits:

1. **Direct Substitution** – The easiest method if it doesn't lead to **0/0**.
2. **Factoring** – Useful when the function can be broken down.
3. **Derivatives** – If the other two fails.

Understanding these techniques will help solve limits efficiently without relying on graphs all the time. Happy learning!
