## Welcome to my first major project for one of my classes in University!
This isn't an end semester project, but still an important one. I basically have to code a game in Python using whatever resources I have, so I made this.

Alright, let's get on with it.

## What's the game about?
My project revolves around the plot where the main character, [Fu Xuan](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Fu_Xuan) from [Honkai: Star Rail](https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/), embarks on an epic quest to obtain a vanilla milkshake. Along the way, players encounter various challenges, including turn-based battles, a cooking minigame, and visual novel style dialogue. You can download the zip file of the raw code [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WrD4h7bwPcNL9g-jWWiU05fan--avIKo).

1. **Storytelling and Humor**
    - The game features playful dialogue and situations, such as Fu Xuan’s unusual request and many others. There is also multiple endings which are all doable while some may require some effort to get (such as letting Fu Xuan die in the Turn Based RPG minigame), which add replayability and fun.

2. **Turn Based minigame**
    - Players control two characters, Fu Xuan and [Qingque](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Fu_Xuan), each with abilities directly from the game and stats from my own personal account. Fu Xuan excels in defensive and keeping the party alive while turning most damage into her, while Qingque offers powerful but RNG attack mechanics. The combat system uses a queue to manage turn order, alternating between characters and the enemy.

3. **Cooking Minigame**
    - A lighthearted path other than combat where players gather ingredients and attempt to create the perfect milkshake (or something else). Depending on the ingredients used, players can unlock multiple endings.

## What's next?
After this, I'm planning to develop the battle system further independently of the project, which will include all of Star Rail's characters and mechanics and all that. It will take a while, but I assure you that I ***will*** make it, whatever it takes.

## Conclusion
This project has been a fantastic way to apply the concepts I’ve learned in my algorithm programming lecture. It’s been both a technical and creative journey, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished so far. Fu Xuan’s quest for a milkshake is a testament to how programming can bring even the wildest ideas to life. I hope to inspire others to take on similar projects and explore the exciting world of game development.
