## Introduction
Today, we're going to review the fundamentals of chain rule. Let's just get on with it.

## Example Question
Let's say we have a question with this equation : 

$$
f(x) = (3x^2 + 5x - 7)^4
$$

Other than the usual chain rule formula, we can use this other form to solve it which is more simple to understand :

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{da} \cdot \frac{da}{dx}
$$

First of all, what even is the **dy** or **dx**? What does the **d** even mean. Let's use dy/dx as an example. This basically means *the derivative of y with respect to x*. Remember that f(x) is basically just y in math. Then, what in the world is **da**. Well, first we have to explain the process of solving the question.

### Step 1 : Assumption

First, if we ever have a question where an entire function inside some parantheses has an exponent, we have to assume that the function iside the parantheses is some random letter (let's say **a**). So, the question from before should look like this.

$$
a = 3x^2 + 5x - 7
$$

$$
f(x) = (a)^4
$$

### Step 2 : Derivative the f(x) and the a

Next, the dy/da part in the formula means that we have to find the derivative of y (f(x)) to the respect of a. We can just use this formula to solve it easier :

$$
f'(x) = n x^{n-1}
$$

So, the answer will be :

$$
\frac{dy}{da} = 4{a}^{3}
$$

Next, we'll find the derivative of the a, which is defined from the formula as da/dx :

$$
\frac{da}{dx} = 6x + 5
$$

### Step 3 : Multiple both of them

Next, all we have to do is multiply both of the dy/da and da/dx and replace the a back with its original equation, which should be :

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{da} \cdot \frac{da}{dx}
$$

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x + 5 \cdot 4{a}^3
$$

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 4 \cdot (6x + 5) \cdot ({3x^2 + 5x - 7})^3
$$

**And we're done!**
