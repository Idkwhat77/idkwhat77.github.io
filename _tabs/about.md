Hello, welcome to my blog! My name is Exsel Octaviand Gosal and I'm a student majoring in Application Development at Ciputra University, Makassar. My hobbies are playing games and coding random things because I'm really interested in experimenting and trying out new things that I can do. Okay, what else... Oh yeah! I love My Singing Monsters music! I know that sounds weird, but they're genuinely really catchy and unique! My favourites are Magical Nexus and Ethereal Workshop, the newest songs in the game.

Currently in my studies, I'm still only coding in Python, but I'm very sure that I'll learn other languages like C and Java sooner or later. Have a nice read!
